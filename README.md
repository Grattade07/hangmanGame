# Hangman Game

This project is a hangman game created using React and styled using Bootstrap and custom css stylesheets.

This application allows the user to play a round of hangman using interactive buttons to guess the randomly-generated hidden word.

The user has 10 guesses to reveal the hidden word or they will have lost the round and then a new round will start.
